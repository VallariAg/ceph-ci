>= 14.2.11
----------

* RGW: The ``radosgw-admin`` sub-commands dealing with orphans --
  ``radosgw-admin orphans find``, ``radosgw-admin orphans finish``,
  ``radosgw-admin orphans list-jobs`` -- have been deprecated. They
  have not been actively maintained and they store intermediate
  results on the cluster, which could fill a nearly-full cluster.
  They have been replaced by a tool, currently considered
  experimental, ``rgw-orphan-list``.

* Now when noscrub and/or nodeep-scrub flags are set globally or per pool,
  scheduled scrubs of the type disabled will be aborted. All user initiated
  scrubs are NOT interrupted.

* Monitors now have a config option ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``, 10 by default.
  If any OSD has repaired more than this many I/O errors in stored data a
 ``OSD_TOO_MANY_REPAIRS`` health warning is generated.
