>=14.2.15
---------

* MON: The cluster log now logs health detail every ``mon_health_to_clog_interval``,
  which has been changed from 1hr to 10min. Logging of health detail will be
  skipped if there is no change in health summary since last known.

14.2.13
-------

* This release fixes a regression introduced in 14.2.12 which broke deployments
  that referred to MON hosts using DNS names instead of IP addresses in the
  ``mon_host`` parameter in ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf``.
