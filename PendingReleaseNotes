>= 14.2.13
----------

* This release fixes a regression introduced in 14.2.12 which broke deployments
  that referred to MON hosts using DNS names instead of IP addresses in the
  ``mon_host`` parameter in ``/etc/ceph/ceph.conf``.

* The structured output of ``ceph status`` or ``ceph -s`` is now more
  concise, particularly the ``mgrmap`` and ``monmap`` sections, and the
  structure of the ``osdmap`` section has been cleaned up.
