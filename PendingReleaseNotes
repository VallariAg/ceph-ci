15.2.8
------
* $pid expansion in config paths like `admin_socket` will now properly expand
  to the daemon pid for commands like `ceph-mds` or `ceph-osd`. Previously only
  `ceph-fuse`/`rbd-nbd` expanded `$pid` with the actual daemon pid.

* ceph-volume: The ``lvm batch` subcommand received a major rewrite. This closed
  a number of bugs and improves usability in terms of size specification and
  calculation, as well as idempotency behaviour and disk replacement process.
  Please refer to https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/ceph-volume/lvm/batch/ for
  more detailed information.

* The ``ceph df`` command now lists the number of pgs in each pool.

* The ``bluefs_preextend_wal_files`` option has been removed.

* It is now possible to specify the initial monitor to contact for Ceph tools
  and daemons using the ``mon_host_override`` config option or
  ``--mon-host-override <ip>`` command-line switch. This generally should only
  be used for debugging and only affects initial communication with Ceph's
  monitor cluster.
