qa/standalone
=============

These scripts run standalone clusters, but not in a normal way.  They make
use of functions ceph-helpers.sh to quickly start/stop daemons against
toy clusters in a single directory.

They are normally run via teuthology based on qa/suites/rados/standalone/*.yaml.

You can run them in a git checkout + build directory as well:

  * The qa/run-standalone.sh will run all of them in sequence.  This is slow
     since there is no parallelism.

  * You can run individual script(s) by specifying the basename or path below
    qa/standalone as arguments to qa/run-standalone.sh.

../qa/run-standalone.sh misc.sh osd/osd-dup.sh

  * To run selected tests, simply add the list of tests to each argument:

../qa/run-standalone.sh "test-ceph-helpers.sh test_get_last_scrub_stamp"

Whenever a test fails, the logs of all involved components are collected
and appended to the output. To simplify the matching of test commands to
components logs, it may be helpful to timestamp the output. On Linux, for
example, one may use 'moreutils's ts(1):

../qa/run-standalone.sh -x -v some-test.sh 2>&1 | ts "%H:%M:%.S" > out_file
